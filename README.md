Challenges Faced
Managing Image Loading States: Implementing a spinner while images are loading was a challenge, particularly when handling multiple image sources. I had to ensure that the user experience remained smooth and visually appealing during load times.

Creating a Dynamic and Responsive UI: Designing the UI to be fully responsive across different devices required a deep understanding of CSS Flexbox and Grid, as well as testing across various screen sizes.

Data Fetching and Error Handling: Integrating with an external API for product data and handling potential errors (like network issues or API downtime) required careful planning and robust error handling mechanisms.

Organizing the Project Structure: Ensuring a clean and maintainable project structure while expanding functionality was challenging. It involved continuously refactoring code to adhere to best practices.

Lessons Learned
Importance of Clean Code and Documentation: Writing clean, modular, and well-documented code made the development process more efficient and easier to debug. It also makes future maintenance and feature additions simpler.

Handling Asynchronous Operations in React: Gained a better understanding of managing asynchronous operations, especially using hooks like useEffect for fetching data and handling state updates effectively.

Improved Knowledge of Next.js: Deepened my understanding of Next.js features such as file-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and client-side rendering (CSR). Learned how to optimize Next.js applications for performance.

User-Centric Design Focus: Learned the importance of providing immediate feedback to users, such as using spinners for loading states, which enhances the overall user experience and engagement.

Future Improvements
Add a Shopping Cart: Implement a shopping cart feature where users can add products, review their selections, and proceed to checkout.
User Authentication: Introduce user authentication for a more personalized experience, allowing users to create accounts, save favorites, and view order history.
Enhanced Search and Filtering: Implement advanced search functionality with multiple filters (e.g., price range, categories, tags) to improve product discoverability.
